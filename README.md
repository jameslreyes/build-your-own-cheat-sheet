Challenge Project: <em>Build Your Own Cheat Sheet</em>

First Challenge Project from Codecademy's Front-End Engineer Career Path. A simple reference sheet for CSS padding and margin properties.

I did a <em><strong>LOT</strong></em> of Googling to get the extra stylistic effects added and working correctly.  Initial iteration of CSS was super clunky and I couldn't figure out how to get the div's centered (lol) regardless of window size.  Took about 30 minutes to an hour of trial and error until I got it working how I liked and with clean code.
